## Quickstart

On your local machine, navigate to the directory in which you want to
create a project directory, and run the following command:

```bash
uvx cookiecutter https://github.com/viseshrp/yapc.git
```

or if you don't have `uv` installed yet:

```bash
pip install cookiecutter
cookiecutter https://github.com/viseshrp/yapc.git
```

Follow the prompts to configure your project. Once completed, a new directory containing your project will be created. Then navigate into your newly created project directory and follow the instructions in the `README.md` to complete the setup of your project.

## Acknowledgements
