## Quickstart

On your local machine, navigate to the directory in which you want to
create a project directory, and run the following command:

```bash
uv pip install cruft  # highly recommended instead of cookiecutter!
cruft create https://github.com/viseshrp/yapc.git
```

Follow the prompts to configure your project. Once completed, a new directory containing your project will be created.
Then navigate into your newly created project directory and follow the instructions in the `README.md` to complete the
setup of your project.

To update your project with the latest changes from the template, you can run:
```bash
cd <your-project-name>
cruft update
```
